Joan's as good as my lady in the dark
all cats are grey in the dark
measure twice and cut once
a penny saved is a penny earned
all that glitters is not gold
absence makes the heart grow fonder
if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas
live by the sword, die by the sword
give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise
