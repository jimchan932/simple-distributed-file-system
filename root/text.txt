Definitions of the word literature tend to be circular.The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary considers literature to be “writings having excellence of
form or expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal interest.” The 19th-century critic Walter Pater referred to “the matter of imaginative or artistic literature” as a “transcript, not of mere fact, but of fact in its infinitely varied forms.” But such definitions assume that the reader already knows what literature is.
